# dot-files
From silicon dust have computers come and to silicon dust shall they return. This repo helps me quickly get up and running on a new machine by being able to copy and paste over my config files. Note that this is not a "how-to" repo, I simply store enough files so that with my own knowledge of what tools that I use I'm able to recreate the same configuration on a new machine. If this proves helpful to someone else then great, if not, tough luck.
