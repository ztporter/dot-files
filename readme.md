# dot-files
From silicon dust have computers come and to silicon dust shall they return. This repo helps me quickly get up and running on a new machine by being able to copy and paste over my config files. Note that this is not a "how-to" repo, I simply store enough files so that with my own knowledge of what tools that I use I'm able to recreate the same configuration on a new machine. If this proves helpful to someone else then great, if not, tough luck.

### 10,000 ft Tool Overview
 - gnome-terminal: terminal (all the config in this repo works just as well on iTerm2)
 - tmux: terminal multiplexer (split panes and that jazz)
 - shell: zsh
 - shell plugin manager: oh-my-zsh (makes managing themes and extensions easier)
 - dracula: color theme I use for basically every program imaginable
 - nerdfont complete: terminal font (has all the crazy glyphs that help show version control status and stuff like that)
 - vim: badass text editor
 - vim-plug: plugin manager for vim
 - editorconfig: helps keep track of tabs vs. spaces nonsense
